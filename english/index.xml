Like when we sit by this lake, I wish I knew what kind of turtle that was, so I could tell him. And I want to finger out what kind of duck that is, so I can tell him about it next time we come. What do you want most for him ? Whatever his dreams are, I&amp;rsquo;m down to ride for him.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://typonotes.com/books/english/capsule-ielts/week-1/task2/Reading-to-Learn-the-Art-of-Expression/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://typonotes.com/books/english/capsule-ielts/week-1/task2/Reading-to-Learn-the-Art-of-Expression/</guid><description>Reading to Learn the Art of Expression
When you read a short story, you may read it merely for pleasure.
When you read a biographical sketch, you may read it merely for information. But as you are a learner of English, I think you should often read to learn the art of expression. And for this purpose you may read either a short story or a biographical sketch, either an essay or a news item, indeed, anything that is written in good current English.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://typonotes.com/books/english/capsule-ielts/week-1/task3/Let-Him-Go-Olivia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://typonotes.com/books/english/capsule-ielts/week-1/task3/Let-Him-Go-Olivia/</guid><description>Let Him Go, Olivia
Alejandro Arbide, San Antonio, Texas.
There I was. Upside down inside the swimming pool. Drowned.
My parents were screaming.
It must have been the summer of &amp;lsquo;63.
It was a gloomy day. Every Sunday we went to my grandparents&amp;rsquo; house.
My cousins and I were playing alongside the pool. I must have slipped.
At three years old, I did not know how to swim.
My mother was giving me CPR.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://typonotes.com/books/english/capsule-ielts/week-1/task3/README/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://typonotes.com/books/english/capsule-ielts/week-1/task3/README/</guid><description>形容词 then 用法详解 核心概念 这里的 then 不是副词“然后”，而是形容词“当时的”。
原句分析 原短语： then recently discovered CPR 字面意思： “在当时那个时间点，新近被发现的心肺复苏术” 结构： then（形容词） + recently discovered（复合形容词） + CPR（名词） 语法功能 时间锚定作用
then 将“新发现”的时间锁定在故事发生的过去时刻，而不是作者写作的现在时刻。
双重时间限定
recently discovered：相对于某个时间点“最近” then：明确指出这个时间点是故事中的1963年 拆解理解 Without then: 新近发现的CPR（可能指现在的新发现） With then: 在当时（1963年） 算是新近发现的CPR 同义转换 &amp;hellip;utilizing CPR, which was, at that time, a recently discovered technique.</description></item><item><title>01.
